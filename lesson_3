When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are not the only one working on the project, or when you are wanting feedback,
or when you need to show the client. 


{Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?}

a fork is the copying of a repository on github but not keeping the connection to the original. A clone is a copy on your computer and keeping a connection, a branch is a separate connection to master that allows changes without changing master until merged. Fork when you are not collaborating, clone when collaborating, branch when doing something experimental or trying to fix a bug.
