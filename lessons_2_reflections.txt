{What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?}
you add the git file to your directory. This is necessary to be able to have 
git track all changes and make snapshots.

{How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?}
the staging area holds files that have been changed, but the changes have had no effect. Once committed those changes then semi-permanently change the filesin the depository and working directory. Advantage is that you can think about the changes before implementing them.

{How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?}
The staging area allows you to see the changes prior to the commit
and allows you to insure it has the correct logical change prior
to performing the commit.

{How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?}
Diagrams help to see what branches are holding what commits, what changes have actually occurred
to the master branch and what changes are temporary.

{What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?}
All of the commits (that are reachable and have a parent) of the braches that are merged are brought on to
one branch. It is represented the way it is to show from where the single branch originated.

{What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?}
merging automatically gives you and easy way to find and fix conflicts.


doing this for automatic login on github

{Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?}
for the same reason you don't want to push automatically. You need to be sure you want the changes,
made on github to be a part of your remote repository.
