{What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?}
you add the git file to your directory. This is necessary to be able to have 
git track all changes and make snapshots.

{How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?}
the staging area holds files that have been changed, but the changes have had 
no effect. Once committed those changes then semi-permanently change the files
in the depository and working directory. Advantage is that you can think about 
the changes before implementing them.
